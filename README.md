First of all, I love writing code. Ever since I wrote my first C ++ program and manipulated it to produce the desired result, I have been obsessed with the idea of â€‹â€‹using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is an endless puzzle that I am passionately committed to solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

For my first professional contract, I had the opportunity to implement the migration of a small system made in Symfony 1 to Symfony 2. My second contract consisted of architecture an existing business model using the best tools and the best performance at that time. This contract quickly turned into a full-time offer and since then I have been expanding my role as a software engineer. Today, I am a senior engineer at Flexy E-Commerce Platform and I work on the backend of our main product, www.flexy.com.br.
Recently, we have implemented a micro front-end in our customer acquisition flow so that it can be dynamically composed using demographic data and allow CI / CD implementations to bring resources to market more quickly.

In recent times of COVID, I have been continuously contributing to the open source community in large and reference projects such as NuxtJS and Symfony, I am currently a collaborator of the official NuxtJS repository, in charge of translations into Spanish and Portuguese under supervision by Debbie Obrien

Even when I leave the office, I usually continue to write code at home. Most recently, I was working on a personal project called, Skwzer.

I do not play any musical instrument but I am also passionate about music. Both challenge many aspects of the intellect: creativity, organization, sequential processing, problem solving. This is what keeps me awake at night, an incessant thirst to create beautiful and powerful things and share them with the world.
